# To do

- [ ] Make icon
- [ ] Customisable button sizing
- [ ] Add support for non-vanilla items as icons
- [ ] Sound buttons
- [ ] Mod menu integration using Cloth Config
- [ ] Subpages (as in a new page with six more buttons)
- [ ] Auto sound categories (i.e. minecraft:entities.cat.* brings a new menu with all the sounds)
